            Thanks for opening this issue! 🙌

            We've added the **investigate** label so the team knows it needs attention. Someone will review it soon.

            In the meantime:
            - Add more details (logs, screenshots, repro steps) if possible
            - Check our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

            Appreciate your help making the project better!
